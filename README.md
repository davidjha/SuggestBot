# SuggestBot
A news and recipes tweeter

SuggestBot is a Twitter bot with the intent to provide its users with daily suggested content. Users will be exposed to new meal recipes, entertained with interesting videos, and kept up to date with new news articles. What makes SuggestBot unique is that it prioritizes less popular content so that users won’t be flooded with content they’ve seen before. This content is conveniently aggregated into tweets for ease of viewing.
    
It can be difficult to decide what to eat, and the most popular ideas aren’t going along with your appetite. Sometimes a less popular idea can sate your appetite or serve as an inspiration to try something new. Another problem that motivated our rationale in creating SuggestBot, is the current climate of increased political polarization. When every news reporting agency is blasting the latest politically charged headline, it can be the case that news that's equally important is ignored.
